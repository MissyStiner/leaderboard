 ## Description
 
 AS A 40-yard dasher <br/>
 I WANT to chart my performance over time <br/>
 SO THAT I can strive for improvement. <br/>

 Runners can sign up, login, add their times for one activity, and view all times for that one activity.

 ## Technologies Used

 Version 2: https://track-future.herokuapp.com/

 ## Future Development Plans
 - Users will be able to log times for more than one activity to see performance at-a-glance for multiple sports.
 - Best entry would be highlighted in a static position as the featured personal best to try to beat.
 - This can be dulicated and used for other activity tracking beyond sports like playing video games.
