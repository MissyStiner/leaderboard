 ## Description
 
 AS A 40-yard dasher <br/>

 ## Future Development Plans
 - Users will be able to log times for more than one activity to see performance at-a-glance for multiple sports.
 - Best entry would be highlighted in a static position as the featured personal best to try to beat.
 - This can be dulicated and used for other activity tracking beyond sports like playing video games.
